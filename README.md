# KawaguchiBank
You are required to develop a Java application for Kawaguchi Bank to assist in calculating car loan installments. The system should offer the following functionalities in the form of menu based interaction:

1.	Display Car Loan Scheme
2.	Calculate Car Loan Installment
3.	Generate Summary Report
4.	Exit

Upon launching the Java application, the system will display a menu with the above numbered listed options for the users to select the task they wish to perform. All inputs must be obtained from the keyboard. Users will need to specify the car type, the loan term, and the loan amount. The system will then calculate and display the necessary car loan information as provided in the table below:

Car Type	Loan Amount (RM)	Interest Rate (%)
Imported 	>300,000	2.35%
	100,000-300,000	2.55%
	<100,000	2.75%
Local 	>100,000	3.0%
	50,000-100,000	3.1%
	<50,000	3.2%

Additionally, the system will prompt the user to indicate whether the borrower wants to purchase loan insurance. The insurance is designed to cover cases where the loan payback is waived in the event of the borrower's death or permanent disability. An additional RM200 (per year) surcharge will be added to the loan amount.

You must form a group of up to five people and develop a car loan system to support the above scenario. Your team are encouraged to apply the object-oriented approach that you have learned in class, including classes, objects, and methods.
